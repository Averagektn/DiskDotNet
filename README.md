# DiskDotNet Appliction for balancing disk data analysis

## Introduction

Musculoskeletal disorders in children are an urgent problem, requiring a comprehensive approach to rehabilitation. Unlike adults, most orthopedic disorders of childhood can be corrected by therapeutic physical training. Low interest of children in the qualitative performance of uniform exercises sharply reduces the effectiveness of treatment and rehabilitation.
One of the solutions in this area is the use of a coordination and rehabilitation complex. Complex, which in a "game form" is applicable for treatment and prevention of dynamic orthopedic disorders of the foot. Orthopedic disorders of the feet and spine, rehabilitation after traumas, long-term immobilization of a limb, training of the vestibular apparatus, coordination,
balance and analyze the dynamics of rehabilitation and recovery. The use of hardware and software complex provides an opportunity to collect and analyze data, as well as to form a history of progress. Analyze data, as well as to form a history of progress and effectiveness. The data obtained make it possible to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the applied techniques, monitor the "game" progress and adapt the rehabilitation program according to his needs. The hardware complex is a unit embedded in the balancing platform. The balancing disk with the hardware complex installed on it is shown in Figure 1. At the size and shape of the balancing platform are not important, which makes this unit easily portable. The following requirements were taken into account during realization: autonomy, possibility of data transmission over the local network and convenience of setting up with the help of the remote setting device Wi-Fi connection.

This app is designed to gather data from such device and trnsmit in mathematical value and graphs in order to simplify the process of data analysis.

## Functionality

This application allows to collect information from the device above and save the data to analyze the rehabilitation dynamics. 
The visualization available is a reproduction of the device position during data collection, a display of the path before and after contact with the target, and a diagram showing which side the subject most often leans to.
